# Personal Shell Settings

This repository contains personal settings for my shells. I work primarily with Node and Ruby so there's references to `rbenv` and `nvm` inside. Remove them if you don't need it.

## Using This

Fork this, make your changes, clone them locally and then run `make deploy`. Backups will be made, postfixing the date to your current files if they exist, so no worries!

## Updating This

If you've made changes to your local files, run `make retrieve` to update the files in this repository before pushing to your own forked repo.
